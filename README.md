This project is my follow-up response to the interview prompt.

  NOTE: 
          It was written AFTER the 4-hour time period alotted to complete the project.
          I feel that I didn't do very well on the timed project, but wanted to complete it anyway,
          to at least demonstrate my coding ability.
